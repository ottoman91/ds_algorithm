In Binary search, the total time cost is O(lgn)(base 2)

In sorting(merge sort), total time cost is O(nlgn). the logn comes from sorting each list, and the n comes from merging all n items together each time we merge two sorted sublists.

for binary tree, O is lg(n + 1)



* in place functions modify data structures outside of their own function calls. they "destroy" the original input.

in place algorithms usually have O(1) space cost.
But in-place algorithms are risky.
